### 🎙️ TASK 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

**Objective:**  
Recognize **human emotions** (e.g., happy, angry, sad) from speech audio.

**Approach:**  
Apply **deep learning** and **speech signal processing** techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Extract features like **MFCCs** (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
- Use models like **CNN**, **RNN**, or **LSTM**.
- Recommended datasets: **RAVDESS**, **TESS**, **EMO-DB**.

### ✍️ TASK 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

**Objective:**  
Identify handwritten **characters or alphabets**.

**Approach:**  
Use **image processing** and **deep learning**.

**Key Features:**
- Dataset: **MNIST** (digits), **EMNIST** (characters).
- Model: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.
- Extendable to full word/sentence recognition using **sequence modeling** (e.g., CRNN).
